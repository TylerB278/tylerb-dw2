  <!-- <h1>Project 01 Proposal</h1>
  <p>For my project 1 topic I would like to make a page for an upcoming event.</p>
  <p>
    I want to make a website that advertises an upcoming esports event on campus.
    For this event we already plan on inviting a bunch of other colleges out to compete.
    The opportunity to have a website that will advertise the event would be a big benefit in order to increase publicity.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would add a nav and a footer that could take you around the page.
    For the three sections I would do one about the event and what it is, 
    another about the invited colleges and the prizes, 
    and a last section about the location and how to sign up.
  </p> -->
