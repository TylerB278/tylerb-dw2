## Event Details

This is the second monthly event in New Paltz Smash Club’s Fall 2025 season.
What makes this event so special? We have invited several nearby schools,
many competing in the online SUNY/ECAC leagues, to all compete offline in one large crew battle event between the schools! 
Many of these schools will also be participating in the main event as well so attendance and competition will be at a high for this event.

The brackets that we will have at the event are as follows:

- Collegiate Crews: 12:00PM
- Rivals of Aether 2 Singles: 12:00PM
- Ultimate Doubles: 12:00PM
- Ultimate Singles: 12:00PM

## Invited Schools

All of the following schools were invited and may be attending the event with at least 4 of their best players.
