# Project 01 Proposal

For my project 1 topic I would like to make a page for an upcoming event.

## What would this project be about?

I want to make a website that advertises an upcoming _esports_ event on campus.
For this event we already plan on inviting a bunch of other colleges out to compete.
The opportunity to have a website that will advertise the event would be a **big** benefit in order to increase publicity.

I would add a **nav** and a **footer** that could take you around the page.
For the three sections I would do one about the event and what it is, 
another about the invited colleges and the prizes, and a last section about the location and how to sign up.
